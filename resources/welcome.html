<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>This is a small prototype to demonstrate a simple question and answer capture.</p>

<p>A questionnaire is developed in a data format called EDN (pron: Eden) which is shown below</p>

<p>This questionnaire can be filled out by clicking on the Questionnaire in the menu above</p>

<p>Already filled out questionnaires are visible via the Submissions menu item. The submitted responses are also in EDN - they are basically the questionnaire itself with answers added.</p>

<p>It is possible to post-process these submissions to provide insights</p>

<p>This prototype is extremely basic, but provides a discussion point for potential directions</p>

<p>Here is the questionnaire :-</p>
